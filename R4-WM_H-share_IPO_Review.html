						<h3>R4-WM_H-share_IPO_Review</h3>
						<p>WM Motor Holdings Limited is an innovative electric vehicle manufacturer that provides autonomous driving solutions, named from the German world champion (Weltmeister). Established in 2015, WM has the No. 1 electric SUV sales figure in 2019 and 2020. The EX5 SUV, in the mainstream market in China, whose retail price is around RMB160,000. The EX5 model has a spacious interior and is equipped with advanced technologies such as Living Pilot AD/ADAS, Living Engine smart cockpit, and Living Motion electric powertrain, which young Chinese families would favor.</p>
						<p>The market is never a blue ocean. WM Motor, NIO, XPeng, Li Auto, and other 'New Forces' started simultaneously. When other EV "New Forces" and new energy vehicle companies began to deliver and entered a critical period of rapid development, WM Motor fell into a bottleneck. From 2019 to 2021, Weimar's deliveries were 12,799, 21,937, and 44,152 respectively. Since September 2018, the total delivery was 83,495. This figure is less than half that of the Tier 1 OEMs, not even the GOAT among the Tier 2 OEMs.</p>

							<h3>Transaction Highlight: Financial</h3>
							<p>Even though having net loss generally happens in the industry, the loss of WM seems significant in the industry. In the reporting period, the WM has the gross loss rate of -41.1%, -43.5%, and -58.3%, far from profiting. The NEV companies generally have lower gross margins compared to other sectors in the supply chain, and WM is one of the companies below the average performance.</p>
							<p>image</p>
							<p>Among comparable companies, Leap has the gross lost rate similar to WM, which also has submitted its prospectus to HKEX. To understand whether these NEV companies are experiencing their last hurdle to profit, or just insisting in despair, we dig deeper into the topline and COGS of WM to understand its profitability.</p>
