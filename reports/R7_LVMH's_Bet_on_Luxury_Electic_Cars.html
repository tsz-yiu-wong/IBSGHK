					<h3>Abstract:</h3>
					<p>LVMH's affiliated PE platform L Catteron announced the SPAC acquisition of 
						Lotus Tech by L Catteron Asia Acquisition Corp. (LCAA). As a luxury EV 
						manufacturer with solid global distribution and getting strong support from Geely, 
						its parent company, Lotus is entering the capital market at a high valuation. We 
						did a comprehensive analysis of the perspective of Lotus and conducted the 
						valuation practices for both Lotus Tech and LCAA. Our De-SPAC model shows 
						a big concern about the deal rooted in the aggressive revenue growth forecast by 
						L Catterton, which may be related their belief in the platform of Geely.

					<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
					<p>On Jan 31, 2023, L Catterton Asia Acquisition Corp (LCAA) announced its acquisition of 
						Lotus, a subsidiary of Chinese automaker Geely, focusing on the high-end EV market. As a 
						SPAC backed by L Catterton, a consumer-focused PE enjoying a special relationship with 
						LVMH, it is a special deal for them to bet on the EV industry. </p>

					<p>Geely takeover the Lotus from Malaysia's Proton in 2017. After that, Geely invested 3 billion 
						pounds in revamping the British brand by opening factories and launching new models. The 
						most recently constructed factory in Wuhan, which can produce 150,000 vehicles a year, will 
						facilitate the manufacture of Lotus' first models. Wuhan's government fund also holds 
						convertible bonds, the Lotus, to promote coordination. </p>
					<p>Lotus Tech has wanted to go public since 2021, aiming to replicate the massive success seen 
						by luxury auto brand listings such as Porsche AG, which pulled off Europe's largest IPO in a 
						decade. This deal is also significant in the history of SPAC as the biggest SPAC deal in almost 
						a year.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">

					</span>
					<p>Lotus announced that the funds acquired from the SPAC listing would be used towards 
						delivering its first model, the electric SUV Eletre. Lotus aims to sell the vehicle in China in the 
						first quarter before expanding to the European Union and Britain. Electre features a bevy of 
						innovations, featuring fully embedded L4 hardware capabilities made possible by the first 
						deployable LiDAR system in the world and a custom software system created by Lotus. The 
						model also feats high energy efficiency, fast data transfer, and supercharging capabilities 800V 
						high-voltage battery. Instead of competing with large EV makers like Tesla, Geely has been 
						steering it away from combustion engines and has several all-electric models planned for the 
						coming years. Lotus wishes to solidify its standing in the luxury EV industry instead, 
						competing with companies like Ferrari and Aston Martin and delivering all-electric, sustainable 
						luxury vehicles worldwide. According to Qingfeng Feng, chief executive of both Lotus Group 
						and Lotus, the merger will position Lotus. as a “leading global luxury EV company” and that 
						the deal brings “promising brand collaboration and strategic partnership potential worldwide.” 
						In its IPO in 2021, LCAA stated that they “intend to focus on our search in high-growth 
						consumer technology sectors across Asia.” In the investor presentation, LCAA projected 
						Lotus's CAGR in 2023E-2025E to be high as 90%. According to Chinta Bhagat, Co-Chief 
						Executive Officer of LCAA, “Lotus Tech is well positioned to benefit from these dynamics, as 
						it is a pioneer in decarbonizing luxury automobiles,” expressing his confidence in Lotus 
						becoming a significant player in the luxury EV industry. </p>

					<h3>2. Revenue Forecast</h3>
					<h4>2.1 Sales Volume Forecast for Luxury Electric Vehicle Market</h4>
					<p>The luxury electric vehicle is defined as electric vehicle whose price is over 80,000 USD and 
						less than 149,000 USD which is Lotus's target price range. According to Lotus's plan, around 
						50% of its sale will be in China and the rest of its sales will be in Europe, the United Kingdom, 
						and the US. This section provides forecast for sales volume and market size of luxury electric 
						vehicles in the given price range by region with some supporting key assumptions. Subsections 
						below will introduce the expected growth rate and changes in market share first, and the 
						detailed forecast data will be shown in the end. The forecast takes forecast from Lotus Investor 
						Presentation, Carolina Journal, Insideevs, CleanTechnica as references. The forecast also uses 
						data from Autohome Inc. and Yahoo! Autos.</p>
					<p><b>2.1.1 Global Sales Volume Forecast</b></p>
					<p>In the global electric vehicle market, the sales volume is expected to grow at a compounded 
						annual growth rate of 30.7% from 2023 to 2025. For the luxury section in the electric vehicle 
						market, the sales volume is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 38%, 
						according to Lotus Technology's expectations. It will result in a fluctuating market share 
						between 1.8% and 1.92% in the electric vehicle market. </p>
					<p><b>2.1.2 China Sales Volume Forecast</b></p>
					<p>In China's electric vehicle market, the sales volume is expected to grow at a compounded 
						annual growth rate of 35.1% with a compounded annual growth rate of 46% in the luxury sector. 
						The market share of luxury electric vehicles in China's electric vehicle market is expected to 
						grow from 0.48% to 0.67% at the same time.</p>
					<p><b>2.1.3 US Sales Volume Forecast</b></p>
					<p>In US electric vehicle market, the sales volume is expected to grow at a compounded annual 
						growth rate of 29% with a compounded annual growth rate of 38% in the luxury sector. The 
						market share of luxury electric vehicles in the US electric vehicle market is expected to grow 
						from 10.42% to 11.92% at the same time.</p>
					<p><b>2.1.4 EU Sales Volume Forecast</b></p>
					<p>In the EU electric vehicle market, the luxury electric vehicle market is expected to grow at a 
						compounded annual growth rate of 36%. The market share of luxury electric vehicles in the 
						EU electric vehicle market is expected to drop from 2.4% to 2.1% simultaneously.</p>
					<p><b>2.1.5 UK Sales Volume Forecast</b></p>
					<p>In UK electric vehicle market, the sales volume is expected to grow at a compounded annual 
						growth rate of 42% with a compounded annual growth rate of 35% in luxury sector. The market 
						share of luxury electric vehicles in the UK electric vehicle market is expected to drop from 
						0.64% to 0.58% at the same time.</p>

					<p><b>2.1.6 China Market Size Forecast</b></p>
					<p>In China's luxury electric vehicle market, the luxury electric vehicle models mainly concentrate 
						around 576,000RMB with a weighted average price of 585,000RMB. The market size is 
						expected to grow at a high rate in 2023 as many new luxury electric models are introduced to 
						China, which will generate rapid growth in the average price of luxury electric vehicles and 
						sales volume. After 2023, the market size is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth 
						rate of 63% in 2024 and 2025 respectively. </p>
					<p><b>2.1.7 Global Market Size Forecast</b></p>
					<p>The price levels used for markets besides China market are different, as existing luxury vehicle 
						models in regions other than China have a higher price range. Though the price levels and 
						growth rates may differ across the regions except for China, here assumes that the price levels 
						and growth rates are like those in the US with some adjustments and the difference is minor 
						which will not affect the forecast result. Here also assumes that the luxury vehicle average 
						prices will not fluctuate severely in the forecast period and will not affect the forecast result. 
						In US luxury electric market, the luxury electric vehicle models mainly concentrate around 
						119,000 USD with a weighted average price of 120,904 USD. The market size is expected to 
						have a compounded annual growth rate of around 38%.

					</span>
					<p><b>2.1.6 Key Assumptions of Growth rate by region</b></p>
					<p>With COP26's ambition of making a 100% share of ZEVs in new car and van sales by 2040 
						globally and by 2035 in “leading markets,” the global electric vehicle sales growth rate in 2022 
						is around 57%. But with the increasing coverage of the main audience of new energy vehicles, 
						the growth rate of sales volume will be at a moderate level around 30.7% according to 
						businessweekly research. In China, as the fuel economy standard tightened with the expected 
						issuance of new luxury models by BYD, NIO and etc., and meanwhile, the China luxury 
						vehicle customer groups are still in the process of accepting electric vehicles, which is a 
						potential driver of the rapid growth of luxury electric sales volume in the future. The luxury 
						electric vehicle sales volume growth rate is expected to be higher than that of the whole electric 
						vehicle market as predicted by EqualOcean Intelligence. US faces a similar situation with a 
						bigger market share of luxury electric vehicles as there are much more existing luxury electric 
						vehicle in the US. For EU and UK, the growth rate is rather slow as the electric vehicle 
						ownership is higher. As predicted by Lotus Technology and other institutions, the luxury 
						electric sales volume will grow slower than the whole electric vehicle market in EU and UK at 
						certain rates mentioned above. </p>

					<p><b>2.2 Competitiveness analysis</b></p>
					<p>As a new entrance to the EV market, whether Lotus's accumulation of technology could 
						support it transform from conventional fuel vehicle brand to new energy vehicle brand is still 
						suspectable.</p>
					<p>So here we choose models mentioned in Lotus's pitch deck together with the top 10 best luxury 
						electric models selected by Forbes Wheels 2023 as the competitors for Lotus to analyse the 
						position of Lotus in luxury electric vehicles market. </p>
					<p><b>2.2.1 Technological analysis</b></p>
					<p>To compare Lotus Eletre with models from other brands, we select eight core indicators to 
						represent the performance of the models. Normally we assume that the higher the price is, the 
						better the performance of a car should be, so price indicator works as a penalty term. 0-100 
						km/h acceleration time is the most widely used indicator for the power capability. 
						</p>
					<p>For the Electrification Performance, Charging Speed and Driving E-range are the indicators 
						that directly affect consumers' daily driving experience. And power consumption reflects 
						whether a car is economical after purchase. </p>
					<p>For the Traditional Metrics, Exterior Design, Interior Design and Comfort scores are sourced 
						from Dongchedi as a reference. The socres are calculated based on the reviews from car owners 
						on Dongchedi. Though not authoritative, the socres still can partily reflect market recognition. 
						The volume indicator is related to the available space of the car which reflect the comfortable 
						capability when using the car. </p>
					<span class="image fit80">

						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure6.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: Electric Vehicle Database, Dongchedi</sub>
					</span>
					<p>To quantify the performance of Lotus on different indicators, we use the overall scope of 
						selected nine models as the total distribution and calculate each indicator's percentile based on 
						the distribution. The lower the percentile and ranking is, the better the performance is.</p>
					<span class="image fit80">
						<p>Figure 7:The percentile of Lotus among different luxury electric vehicles</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure7.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: Filings</sub>
					</span>
					<p>Then we give different weight to each indicator based on its different impact on the overall 
						performance and competitiveness of the car. For example, though Volume and Exterior and 
						Interior Design influence consumers' decisions when buy cars, those Electrification indicators 
						are more important than them. So we give Traditional Metrics lower weights compared to 
						Electrification.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 8:The weighted average percentile of Lotus among different luxury electric vehicles</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure8.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: Filings</sub>
					</span>
					<p>The Final Percentiles for Lotus Eletre S and Lotus Eletre R are 0.37 and 0.43, which mean that 
						the models of Lotus are competitive compared to those existing and excellent competitors in 
						luxury electric vehicles market.</p>
					<p><b>2.2.2 Sales analysis</b></p>
					<p>The number of direct sales stores and dealerships will affect the convenience of consumers to 
						access and buy cars, which is positively related to the sales volume of the brand. Besides, the 
						distribution of stores and dealerships also reflects corporate's different priority on each 
						country/region. It is reasonable that the brand should perform better in country/region of higher 
						priority as it devotes more resource and efforts to that country/region.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 9: The number of direct sales stores and dealerships of different brand</p>

						<sub>Source: Tesla, ScrapeHero, Datanify, Automotive News Europe</sub>
					</span>
					<p>Because Lotus is a UK-based sports car brand, the number of Lotus's existing stores in China 
						is not significant. Lotus plans to rapidly expand its business and expects to have 130 stores in 
						China by 2025. Compared to those historic brands like BMW and Benz, the number of Lotus's 
						stores is still lagged far behind even after the expansion. But the gap may mainly because the 
						models of BMW and Benz cover both luxury vehicles and regular vehicles. When compared 
						to Tesla and Porsche, the progress of Lotus's expansion is still considerable. </p>
					<p><b>2.3 Revenue Forecast</b></p>
					<p>Since Lotus devotes different efforts to different countries/regions, we need to give different 
						market share assumptions for each country/region. </p>
					<p>Based on the number of Lotus's direct sales stores and dealerships in different regions and 
						Lotus's technology advantages compared to other brands, we give the assumption of Lotus's 
						market shares in different regions as follow. </p>
					<span class="image fit60">

					<a name="valuation"><br></a>
					<h3>3. Valuation</h3>
					<h4>3.1 Selecting the Multiple</h4>
					<p>In the EV industry, the market approach of valuation usually chooses revenue multiple as most 
						companies are not yet profiting due to the universal low margin in the industry. The acquisition 
						of Lotus also applies revenue multiple as the valuation methodology and 0.9x 2024E revenue 
						or 0.6x 2025E revenue to the deal, implying an EV of US$ 5,447 million. </p>

					<h4>3.2 Comparables and Target Range</h4>
					<p>We put the comparable companies into two groups to weigh their comparability. As a 
						pure-play EV company, Lotus is more comparable to listed EV manufacturers.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 11: Comparable Companies</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure11.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: Wind</sub>
					</span>
					<p>We believe Chinese mixed auto manufacturers, e.g., Lotus parent company Geely, can help 
						determine the proper valuation of Lotus with a lower weight. </p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 12: Weight of Groups of Comparables</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure12.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: IBSG Research</sub>
					</span>
					<p>The comparable company indicates a 3x 2022 revenue multiple based on the weight assigned 
						above. This is equivalent to a forward multiple of 0.83x1 2024E revenue and 0.61x2 2025E 
						revenue, which is close to the acquisition's valuation multiple of 0.9x 2024E revenue or 0.6x 
						2025E revenue. </p>
					<p>Therefore, we believe 0.6x 2025E revenue multiple is most proper for valuating the company. </p>


					<a name="de"><br></a>
					<h3>4. De-Spac</h3>
					<h4>4.1 Cash and Valuation Metrics</h4>
					<p>The 2021 IPO of LCAA exercised full greenshoes. Assuming no redemption by LCAA's 
						shareholders, the trust has $288 million cash. Jingkai Fund, a government fund of Wuhan city, 
						China, is expected to exercise equity conversion of its convertible bond, providing an additional 
						source of cash. Lotus also hopes to raise $100 million of 3rd party investment before the closing. 
						Before the PIPE, the cash balance of the merged entity is calculated as follows.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 13: Cash Source</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure13.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: LCAA Investor Presentation</sub>
					</span>
					<p>Based on the cash and debt level, we can get the following valuation metrics with the projected 
						revenue in the second part of the report. The base case is 0.6x revenue in 2025, corresponding 
						to an EV of 3471 and the LCAA pre-deal share price of 6.49. </p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 14: Valuation Metrics</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure14.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: IBSG Research</sub>
					</span>
					<h4>4.2 Ownership</h4>
					<p>The original shareholders of Lotus, including Geely, still hold the majority stake in the merged 
						entity. The post-De-Spac ownership considers the minimum conversion of Jingkai Fund's 
						convertible bonds. Like most of the SPAC deals, the original shareholders of Lotus roll over 
						all its equity interest.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 15: Ownership after De-Spac</p>
						<img src="../images/report_images/R7_LVMH's_Bet_on_Luxury_Electic_Cars/figure15.png" alt>
						<sub>Source: LCAA Investor Presentation, IBSG Research</sub>
					</span>
					<p>The potential PIPE may further dilute the equity while expanding Lotus's billion-level cash 
						balance for expansion.</p>
					<p><b>4.3 LCAA's Profit</b></p>
					<p>It is widely discussed how much the Sponsor of SPAC deals profits from the Sponsor promote. 
						To date, L Catterton holds 30% Sponsor Shares in SPAC, which is higher than the usual 
						practice of 25%. The Sponsor Shares are subjected to earn-out and forfeiture arrangements tied 
						to Sponsor's affiliates' participation in the following PIPE financing and strategic partnership 
						with Lotus Tech, and 5% of Sponsor Shares may be transferred to certain LCAA public 
						shareholders to induce such public shareholders not to exercise their redemption rights. Based 
						on the merger valuation, the 30% Sponsor Shares have a net worth of $78 million based on the 
						valuation on the merger.</p>

					<a name="conclu"><br></a>
					<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
					<p>The stock price in the base case (0.6x revenue) of the company value is far below $10, so we 
						cannot justify the acquisition valuation of Lotus. </p>
					<p>Our valuation ratio is consistent with the acquisition. Still, the implied revenue CAGR is lower 
						than the acquisition valuation growth rate of 90%. </p>
					<p>To calculate the expected revenue of Lotus in 2025, we predict the market size of luxury 
						electric vehicles by region and evaluate Lotus's competitiveness by technology and sales 
						ability. To justify the 90% growth rate assumption, either of the two unrealistic assumptions 
						should be satisfied. First, the annual growth rates of the market size of luxury electric vehicles 
						are greater than 50% in US and EU and more than 100% in China. Second, The technology of 
						Lotus grows hugely in the following five years, thus giving Lotus a significant competitive 
						edge over its competitors and leading to immense growth in Lotus's market share.  </p>


					<a name="risk"><br></a>
					<h3>6. Risks</h3>
					<h4>6.1 Exchange Rate Risk</h4>
					<p>The China and EU luxury electric vehicle market size is converted from RMB to USD using 
						the exchange rate of 1RMB=0.14 USD. If FED keeps going on the interest rate hike, in that 
						case, the exchange rate fluctuation will affect the calculated luxury electric vehicle market size 
						in different regions and thus influence the projected revenue of Lotus. </p>
					<h4>6.2 China Luxury Electric Vehicle Market Size is overestimated</h4>
					<p>The market size calculation assumes that more luxury electric vehicle models with higher 
						prices will be on sale in China regarding the enclosed plan of several luxury vehicle brands like 
						Audi in the coming years. If the sale of new models in the coming years meets obstacles such 
						as insufficient capacity, the average price and sale volume of luxury electric vehicles will be 
						lower than the estimation, resulting in a market size more melancholy than the prediction. </p>
					<p>Another risk that may arise is China's acceptance of luxury EVs. Although figures estimate 
						that the CAGR of luxury EV sales is expected to rise to 35.1% from 2023 to 2025, current sales 
						may speak a different story. A study on luxury vehicle consumption has shown that brand 
						recognition and perception are the main driving forces of expensive vehicle purchases. 
						However, even renowned brands such as Mercedes Benz have problems with EV sales. The 
						Mercedes EQS Sedan's poor performance of 8,000 units sold may be attributed to the Chinese 
						market not accepting the concept of luxury EVs entirely. With Lotus' brand not fully built in 
						the Chinese market, this effect may have an even more significant impact on the sales of Lotus' 
						Type 133 model, a luxury sedan set to release in 2024, as Lotus. </p>
					<p><b>6.3 Market Share of Lotus is overestimated </b></p>
					<p>The competition in luxury electric vehicles is not fierce as it is still an emerging market. 
						However, as more and more manufacturers enter the market, the competitive power of Lotus 
						will likely be challenged. Though Lotus has a comparative advantage in technology, it needs a 
						more decisive advantage to help it beat the newcomers in the market. Also, its dealerships and 
						the number of direct sale stores don't grant an outstanding benefit for more sales volume. And 
						thus, the market share of Lotus may be lower than predicted due to the possible competition in 
						the market.</p>
					<p><b>6.4 Logistical Risk</b></p>
					<p>All the forecasts made by Lotus are under the assumption that Lotus Tech will complete its 
						global commercial platform according to its master distribution agreement with Lotus UK. 
						Without this agreement, the company will be limited by different national systems, hindering 
						its sales in Europe and America. Since Lotus tech runs on an asset-light model, thus not 
						manufacturing any of the goods, this agreement is instrumental for Lotus Tech to maintain its 
						business model. </p>
					<p><b>6.5 Fund Acquisition Risk</b></p>
					<p>Without a 788-million-dollar fund by the end of 2024 from the LCAA trust and other 
						fundraising methods, the risk of the company's operation and research capabilities will be 
						severely handicapped. The fund is instrumental for the company to deliver its models after 
						2023, which will make up the bulk of the sales in the future as forecasted.</p>
