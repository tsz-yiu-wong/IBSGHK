					<h3>Abstract:</h3>
					<p>This study introduces the gold market trend in 2022 and provides analysis provided with 
						historical evidence. It focuses on the key and newly launched gold products in the gold market 
						and put themselves in the context of the main exchanges in different regions. By observing the 
						seasonal change in gold prices, the study introduces two short-term trading strategies by 
						catching the average monthly return and the moving average crossover. By analyzing the 
						reverse relation between the gold prices and other macroeconomic factors, the study introduces

					<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
					<p>Based on the characteristics of gold, its price usually has a negative relationship with USD, 
						which can be regarded as an ideal financial instrument to hedge currency risk and inflation risk 
						by domestic retail investors and foreign investors. Investors can use a variety of instruments to 
						invest in the performance of gold, among which gold futures (including financial instruments 
						based on gold futures) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) based on physical gold are used 
						most often. Different exchanges are holding different kinds of gold products, allowing traders 
						to take different strategies. Focusing on market patterns, both short-term and long-term trading 
						strategies can create value for investors. </p>


					<a name="market"><br></a>
					
					<h3>2. 2022 Gold Market Trend</h3>
					<p>Since 2008, the prices of real estate and physical assets like gold skyrocketed. Investors thus 
						usually own gold to hedge against the risks of USD depreciation and the resulted inflation: if 
						you own gold that is priced by USD, then USD depreciation leads to rise in cost of gold in 
						dollar, so that gold price increases.</p>

					</span>
					<p>From the gold price change in 2022, we see the price has not fallen below 1600 once, which 
						fully shows gold's stable and less correlated performance amid market turbulence. Inflation
						and geopolitics led to weak institutional demand (ETFs/OTC/Futures) yet was offset by other 
						buying forces. </p>
					<p>First, retail investment. Despite the institutional malaise and heightened geopolitical risk, retail 
						investors had an eight-year high ytd demand in gold in Q3 2022 - they bought almost 400 tons 
						of gold altogether. Particularly for non-US investors, gold proved a lucrative investment in 
						2022, gaining well in their local currencies. Second, central banks had an exceptional year of 
						net buying. Central banks are scooping up gold at the fastest pace since 1967, buying 50 tons 
						of gold in November, up 47% month-to-month. Data compiled by the World Gold Council 
						(WGC) has shown demand for the precious metal has outstripped any annual amount in the 
						past 55 years.</p>

					<p>Gold held above $1,900 an ounce in the end of 2022, hovering near its strongest level since the 
						firm expectations that the fed will slow the pace of its interest rate hikes: After delivering a 50-
						bps increase in the fed rate December, the market is currently expecting the fed to downshift 
						to a smaller 25-bps rate hike in February. Consumer prices in the UK also fell for the second 
						straight month in December, adding to further signs that inflationary pressures may have finally 
						peaked, so in early 2023 gold price may increase as well.</p>

					<h3>3. Gold Products</h3>
					<p>The positive performance of the gold index is prompting investors to add gold to their portfolios, 
						as a hedge against volatile stock returns, high inflation, and lagging economic growth. Investors 
						can use a variety of instruments to invest in the performance of gold, such as gold bars, mining 
						stocks and derivative-based financial products. </p>
					<p>Two gold investment vehicles more commonly used by professional investors are gold futures 
						(including financial instruments based on gold futures) and exchange-traded products (ETPs) 
						based on physical gold.</p>
					
					<h4>3.1 ETPs</h4>
					<p>Gold ETPs were created in the early 2000s to combine the liquidity and tradability 
						characteristics of stocks or mutual funds with the attractive store of value and diversification 
						characteristics of physical gold. The gold tracked by physical gold ETPs is held in vaults by 
						custodians on behalf of investors.</p>
					<p>ETPs can be bought and sold in the same way as stocks, and as easy to execute and manage. 
						Each ETP is backed by an allotment of physical gold and offers ordinary investment in gold 
						prices. In a sense, when investors buy ETP, they are paying to have someone else manage their 
						physical gold investment.</p>
					<p>The custody of gold ETP is highly concentrated, and investors should understand the relevant 
						counterparty risks. In most cases, investors are required to pay the full amount invested in the 
						gold ETP.</p>
					
					<h4>3.2 Derivative-based instruments</h4>
					<p>Derivative-based financial instruments are another tool for investing in the performance of gold, 
						often referred to as gold derivative investments. The most common instruments are gold futures 
						contracts, ETPs based on gold index futures and indices, or swaps based on derivative gold 
						indices.</p>
					<p>The futures market provides an efficient price-setting mechanism for market participants in a 
						highly regulated market environment. Futures are highly liquid and offer standardized contracts, 
						attracting investment from a wide range of participants, such as hedgers and speculators. As 
						far as gold is concerned, the volume of gold traded on exchanges or over-the-counter dwarfs 
						that of ETPs. The price of gold futures contracts is determined by many participants, while 15 
						financial institutions participate in ETP to determine the LMBA gold price.</p>
					<p>A major advantage of investing in gold through the futures market is that there is very little
						counterparty risk; gold futures are traded and settled on well-established and well-regulated 
						futures exchanges, and buyers and sellers do not meet in the transaction.</p>
					<p>Investing in commodities using commodity futures typically does not require the full amount 
						invested and therefore may be more capital efficient. Investors or asset managers will use a 
						relatively large proportion of their allocated assets to buy Treasuries and other fixed-income 
						instruments, thereby providing collateral for futures contracts.</p>

					<h3>4.Gold Exchanges </h3>
					<p>Gold is used to make jewelry and coins. It is also used in electronics, dentistry, decorative and 
						industrial fabrication. Customers can walk into any jewelry stores or banks for gold accessories 
						and gold bars. Instead of physical gold, investors with hedging and speculative purposes turn 
						attention to gold forwards and futures. </p>
					<p>The market for gold consists of a physical gold market where bullion is transferred between 
						market agents and a paper gold market which is traded in claims of physical stocks. Bullion 
						markets serves as a bridge between larger suppliers (producers and central banks) and investors 
						and fabricators. Paper gold market consists of many paper gold instruments such as gold futures, 
						gold options, gold warrants, gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and other contracts. Some 
						of the gold products are introduced detailed in the above section. Since most of the instruments 
						in paper gold market are liquid and standardized, they are usually traded within exchanges 
						around the world. Gold futures are usually traded on the commodity exchange or over the 
						counter. ETFs are usually traded on the stock exchange. For example, in India, gold futures 
						contracts were introduced on Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) owing to the 
						heightened volatility observed in gold prices. These contracts are drafted to cater to the hedging 
						and investment needs of market participants such as importers, exporters, jewelry 
						manufacturers and investors. And the idea of gold ETFs was first introduced by Benchmark 
						Asset Management Company in India in 2002. There are 27 gold ETFs listed in the National 
						Stock Exchange.</p>

					</span>

					<h4>4.1 Futures and Options Exchanges</h4>
					<p>The first gold futures contract was launched at the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in 1972. 
						Soon after, when the ban of purchasing and holding gold by U.S. residents was lifted on 
						December 31, 1974, five exchanges (two in New York and three in Chicago) began to trade 
						gold futures in the United States. The Commodity Exchange of New York (COMEX) has
						since come to dominate the market in gold futures almost completely.</p>
					<p><b>4.1.1 Loco London</b></p>
					<p>Governed by LBMA and running 24 hours a day through London, the London Bullion Market 
						- as it's known to its members - provides flexibility in pricing, size of deals and length of 
						contract. It also maintains confidentiality and ensures that all risks exist only between the two 
						counterparties. LBMA's gold price is regarded as global benchmark.</p>
					<p><b>4.1.2 COMEX</b></p>
					<p>Both futures and options contracts are quoted in U.S. dollars an ounce, with a contract size of 
						100 ounces (995 fineness), and a tick size of $0.1 an ounce (or $10 a contract).</p>
					<p>The membership of the Commodity Exchange falls into three categories: (1) floor members 
						who trade for other members as agents; (2) market-makers (or "locals") who trade for 
						themselves as principals; and (3) commission houses that execute trades for the public.</p>
					<p><b>4.1.3 Shanghai Futures Exchange</b></p>
					<p>The supply of gold in the world gold market is from: the mineral gold of the gold-producing 
						countries; regeneration of gold; gold sold officially, e.g., gold sold by People's Bank of China 
						or International Monetary Fund.</p>
					<p>The demand for gold consists of consumer demand, reserve demand, and investment demand.</p>
					<p><b>4.1.4 Relations and Comparison between the Exchanges</b></p>
					<p>This is a historical comparison in 1989.</p>

					<h4>4.2 ETFs Exchanges</h4>
					<p>When selecting gold ETFs, we will usually compare the fund and the products. Some gold 
						ETFs outperform the others because each fund has their unique investment strategies. For 
						example, some ETFs focused on the physical gold while the others focus on the gold futures 
						and gold forwards. Some are actively managed, and some are passively managed. Additionally, 
						gold ETFs can be benchmarked against other indexes. For example, some ETFs are 
						benchmarked against AUX index or US Global Go Gold index. If the ETF outperforms or 
						underperforms the benchmark index, the comparison will be reflected on its price. In this 
						section, we ignore the difference between the single products. We focus on the ETF Exchanges 
						and especially in North America, Europe and Asia where large volume of gold ETFs are traded 
						every da</p>
					<p><b>4.2.1 United States</b></p>
					<p>Not all stock exchanges in the US have gold ETFs, but many do. The Nasdaq, NYSE, and OTC 
						exchanges all have gold ETFs. These ETFs can track the spot price of gold, a gold index, or a 
						basket of gold-related stocks. Additionally, there are ETFs that invest in physical gold, such as 
						the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD).</p>
					<p><b>4.2.2 Europe</b></p>
					<p>There are over 30 stock exchanges in Europe. The largest and most well-known exchanges are 
						the London Stock Exchange, Euronext, the Deutsche Börse, and the Borsa Italiana. 
						Additionally, there are several smaller exchanges in countries such as Denmark, Finland, 
						Norway, and Sweden.</p>
					<p><b>4.2.3 Asia</b></p>
					<p>In China, gold ETFs are offered by a number of exchanges, including the Shanghai Stock 
						Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. In Hong Kong, gold ETFs are offered by a 
						number of exchanges, including the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Shanghai-Hong Kong 
						Stock Connect. </p>
					<p>In Tokyo, gold ETFs are offered by a number of exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock 
						Exchange and the Nikkei Stock Exchange.</p>
					<p>In India, gold ETFs are offered by a number of exchanges, including the National Stock 
						Exchange of India and the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
					<p>The gold ETFs' prices will also be affected by geography. For example, gold ETFs that are 
						traded on the London Stock Exchange may have different prices compared to gold ETFs that 
						are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, due to differences in the local supply and demand 
						for gold in those markets. Additionally, gold ETFs that are traded in different currencies, such 
						as the US Dollar or the Euro, may also have different prices, due to differences in the exchange 
						rates.</p>

					<h3>5. Typical gold trading strategies</h3>
					<h4>5.1 Short-term trading strategies: Buy Gold in the trading months with above average return</h4>
					<p>The price of gold tends to follow a seasonal pattern.</p>
					<span class="image fit60">
						<p>Figure 5: Gold's average monthly return since 1973</p>

					</span>
					<p>We can see that Gold has traded below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the previous market 
						swing. But this action happened and we can see that gold price started picking up right from 
						the start of January 2018.</p>
					<p>If the price of Gold at the time of your analysis is trading at support you can go ahead and buy 
						it. However, if the market starts rallying before we enter into January, wait until we break above 
						previous resistance to buy gold.</p>
					<p>As you can see the actual gold price followed its seasonality cycle.</p>

					</span>

					<h4>5.2 Short-term trading strategies: Moving average crossover</h4>
					<p>Moving average crossover strategy: A trader would look to buy gold if a shorter-term moving 
						average above a longer-term moving average and sell when the shorter-term moving average 
						crosses below the longer-term average.</p>
					<span class="image fit80">
						<p>Figure 7: Moving average crossover</p>

					</span>

					<h4>5.3 Long-term trading strategies: Inverse relation between gold price and US real rate</h4>
					<p>Longer-term position traders and investors can focus more on the fundamentals driving gold's 
						price, such as the level of real interest rates. The chart below shows the relationship between 
						gold prices and the yield on TIPS, a proxy for real interest rates in the United State.</p>
