					<h3>1. Overview of AIGC</h3>
					<p>This section discusses the upper stream and downstream sectors of the AI industry. The upper stream focuses on computing power and data services, including pretraining, finetuning, and inference training of AI models, while the downstream sector, also known as the applied AI sector, applies AI technologies to various industries such as finance, healthcare, retail, and media. </p>
					<h4>1.1 The Upper stream: computing power and data services</h4>
					<p>The upper stream industry chain of AIGC consists of computing power and data services. For overall computing power: pretraining refers to the use of large-scale unlabeled data to train a model, so that the model can learn common features and structures. Finetuning refers to the process of supervised fine-tuning of a pre-trained model using annotated data to adapt it to a specific task. During the finetuning stage, the model can be trained with relatively less annotated data in a shorter period. "Inference training refers to the training of a model on inference tasks using the finetuned model, in order to further improve the model's performance and generalization ability.</p>

					</span>
					<p>1.1.1 Training</p>
					<p>The AI chip is the 'heart' of AI computing: With the increasing amount of data, complex algorithm models, heterogeneous processing objects, and high computing performance requirements, AI chips are increasingly used to efficiently handle diverse and complex computing tasks in AI applications. Among them, GPUs are better at parallel computing than CPUs. CPUs are latency-oriented computing units, while GPUs are throughput-oriented computing units, which are used to execute multi-task parallelism. Due to the differences in microarchitecture, most transistors of the CPU are used to build control circuits and caches, with only a small portion of transistors used for computation, while GPUs have stream processors and VRAM controllers using most transistors, resulting in more powerful parallel computing and floating-point computing capabilities. AI servers, as the carrier of supercomputing chips, demonstrate their importance: Unlike general-purpose servers that use a serial architecture with CPUs as the computing provider, AI servers adopt heterogeneous architectures, such as CPU+GPU, CPU+TPU, CPU+other accelerator cards, and other different combinations. Currently, the most widely used is the CPU+GPU combination. Compared to general-purpose servers, AI servers have better high-performance computing capabilities. In the future, with the continuous growth of computing power and the deepening development of AI models such as natural language processing, images, and videos, AI servers will be more widely used.</p>
					<p>Operator computing support: In 2022, the three major domestic operators actively supported the development of the digital economy, and the related business income of industrial digitalization grew rapidly. Currently, industrial digitalization has become the main driving force for the growth of the three major operators. At the same time, the three major operators continued to increase their investment in computing network construction in 1H22, with a total capital expenditure of 162.05 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 27%. From the perspective of capital expenditure structure, operators' investment in digital transformation, represented by cloud computing and computing networks, has gradually increased. From the annual work conference of the three major operators in 2023, it can be observed that in the future, operators will continue to play a leading role in the construction of China's digital economy and further accelerate the construction of computing infrastructure. </p>
					<p>Servers: according to IDC, the global high-performance server market for AI work will grow by 51.4% YoY in 2022, and the shipment growth rate of the domestic server market is expected to rebound to 6.41% in 2023. </p>
					<p>Switches: IDC predicts that the domestic Ethernet switch market size will grow by 9.2% YoY in 2023. The upgrading of computing power will drive the accelerated deployment of 200/400G high-speed products. At the same time, the rapid development of AIGC acceleration will lead to the rapid increase of switch chip speed and power consumption. </p>
					<p>Optical communication: the estimated demand for 20,000 GPUs for ChatGPT large models in 2023 will reach 30,000 when commercialized. Referring to the network architecture of NVIDIA GPU H100, an average of five optical modules can be matched with a single GPU. The popularity of AI models will bring a significant increase in demand for optical modules. </p>
					<p>NVIDIA's business model aims to create a computing stack or neural network-like structure, consisting of four layers of hardware, system software, platform software, and applications. The company leverages its full-stack innovation capabilities in chips, systems, and software to build an accelerated computing platform and improve its GPU, CPU, and DPU chip product structures for AI acceleration and data centers.

					<p>1) efficient vector queries: traditional relational database queries are mainly based on conditions and logical operations, while vector database queries are based on vector similarity matching. By using vector similarity algorithms, vector databases can quickly query data that is most like a certain vector.</p>
					<p>2) good scalability: vector databases usually support the storage and querying of large-scale vector data and can easily scale the system's performance by adding more nodes. </p>
					<p>3) better data visualization: vector databases can convert high-dimensional vector data into points in low-dimensional space for data visualization and understanding. </p>
					<p>4) better machine learning support: vector databases can store and query training datasets and model parameters as part of machine learning models, which helps simplify the process of model deployment and debugging.</p>
					<p>Data is the foundation of the data factor market. As a new production factor, data is the foundation of digitization, networking, and intelligence, and has quickly integrated into various aspects of production, distribution, circulation, consumption, and social service management. The upstream of the data factor market industry chain is data suppliers, the middle stream is data exchanges, data storage, database and other technology and service providers, and the downstream is application merchants of data resources. We believe that the source and existence of the data factor market lie in data. Only when society accumulates a large amount of data and produces data products can it be traded in the market.</p>

					<h4>1.2 The downstream: AI technology Applications</h4>
					<p>The downstream of the AI industry usually refers to the area of the industry where technologies regarding artificial intelligence are applied into products or services.

Through utilizing the technologies listed above, AI used in defense can more accurately take in commands as well generate combat data that is more accurate than ever before to aid battle autonomous AI’d decision analytics.</p>
					<p>One company that has utilized this new age of data generation into their autonomous battle pilots AIs is Shield AI. Their AI pilot “Hivemind” is the first and only autonomous pilot that has been deployed in combat by the US military since 2018. Similar to a human pilot, Hivemind reacts to the battlefield using its built-in decision-making algorithm. With the program not requiring any GPS or aids to conduct missions, it enables intelligent teams of unmanned aircrafts to perform missions ranging from room clearance with Novas, penetrating air defense systems with V-Bats, to dogfighting F-16s. The aircraft uses sensors to create a map or world-view, the computer then tells the aircraft or autopilot where to go and what to do to execute its mission. Using data generated from a self-direct learning in simulations using a technique called reinforcement learning, the AI is able to utilize visual analysis to generate a database of strategies on how to best complete missions. Thanks to the improvement of its battle data generation, the Hivemind was able to defeat human pilots in a dogfight scenario in the DARPA AlphaDogfight Trials. Shield AI has received over 573.1 million dollars' worth of funding, including funding from US Air Force’s Strategic Funding Increase Program. With a valuation of  .3 billion dollars, Shield AI is set to become the leader regarding autonomous pilot AIs.</p>
					<p>In conclusion, the AI industry's downstream provides many lucrative opportunities. Whether it be revolutionizing old technology through application AGI like Viz.ai or aiding the creation of brand-new autonomous battle pilots using an enhanced system of data generation, the opportunities are limitless.</p>
