					<h3>Abstract:</h3>
					<p>The essay discusses three different options of financial instruments: SOFR derivatives, Reverse 
						Convertibles, and Green Bonds. The first option discusses trading SOFR Derivatives, which 
						are futures contracts based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The second option 
						introduces Reverse Convertibles, a type of bond whose yields are linked to the performance of 
						a single stock. Finally, Green Bonds are explored as a fixed-income investment that is 
						specifically earmarked to raise money for climate and environmental projects. While these 
						options differ in their structure and target audience, they all offer investors the opportunity to 
						diversify their investment portfolios and potentially achieve higher returns.</p>

					<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
					<p>In recent years, the financial market has been evolving, and a new range of instruments have 
						emerged. From Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) derivative, Reverse Convertibles, 
						to Green Bonds, investors have been seeking innovative ways to invest and create new sources 
						of revenue. SOFR Futures, for example, is considered a reliable indicator of market 
						expectations of SOFR and has led to liquidity, margin savings, and easy spread trading against 
						Eurodollar and Fed Fund futures. Reverse Convertibles (RCNs) are a type of bond whose yields 
						are linked to the performance of a single stock and can be suitable for investors looking for 
						predictable, higher-income streams than traditional fixed-income investments. Finally, Green 
						Bonds are specifically earmarked to raise money for climate and environmental projects, and 
						besides helping companies to gain a good reputation and enhance their green profile, they also 
						provide incentives for investors to buy, such as risk diversification.</p>

					<h3>2. SOFR Derivative</h3>
					<h4>2.1 SOFR Mechanism and Implication</h4>
					<p>Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a fully-transaction based, nearly risk-free 
						reference rate, and being recognized by the S&P Global to be the “anchor money market 
						reference rate”. Its main difference comparing to LIBOR is how the rates are produced. While 
						LIBOR is based on panel bank input, SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash 
						overnight collateralized by US.</p>

					<p>SOFR is calculated as a transaction -volume-weighted median repo rate. Below are 2 mini 
						versions of SOFR calculation example.</p>
					
					<p>(1) Let's assume that for a 3-day period, not including weekends or holidays, SOFR rates are 
						1.00%, 1.20%, and 1.40%. The annualized rate is given by:</p>
					<p><b>((1+1.00%*1/360)*(1+1.20%*1/360)*(1+1.40%*1/360)-1)*(360/3)*100% = 1.200039630%</b></p>

					<p>(2) When a rate is over the weekend or a holiday, simple interest is calculated. For example, 
						assume on a Friday, SOFR is 1.50%. This would cover three days of simple and not 
						compounded interest, or:</p>
					<p><b>(1+1.50/100*3/360)=1.000125000</b></p>

					<p>Now let's assume there are 6 days in our contract period. The calculation would be as follows:</p>
					<p><b>((1+1.00/100*1/360)*(1+1.2/100*1/360)*(1+1.40/100*1/360)*(1+1.50/100*3/360)-1)*(360/6)*100=1.350094818</b></p>
					

					<h4>2.2 SOFR Products Details</h4>

					<p>SOFR products are mostly traded via CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace. 
						In January 2023, they announced new milestones in the growth of SOFR derivatives contracts, 
						with a single-day record of 7.6 million SOFR futures and options traded and record open 
						interest of 35.7 million contracts on January 12.</p>

					</span>

					<p>Likewise, CME Cleared SOFR swaps volume was $306 billion notional in January 2023, and 
						notional outstanding grew to $2.19 trillion, with SOFR-indexed trades represented 78% of the 
						USD trades cleared at CME in January 2023.</p>

					</span>

					<p>SOFR Future contracts that CME Group lunches are mainly 3-month and 1-month contracts. 
						3-month SOFR Futures are consecutive quarterly contracts reflecting SOFR expectations 
						between IMM dates, listings extend out 10 years, providing a term structure to fulfil risk 
						management needs. 1-month SOFR Futures offers finer granularity for framing market 
						expectations of future SOFR values over the nearest 13 calendar months.</p>

					<h4>2.3 Charm of SOFR Product</h4>

					<p>There are many reasons why investors may trade SOFR Futures. First, Futures are a reliable 
						indicator of market expectations of SOFR. Second, SOFR Futures lead liquidity, with 1 tick 
						wide markets out 5 years. The tick refers to the minimum price fluctuation, or the smallest price 
						increment in which the prices are quoted, which is 1/4 of a 1/32. This means that SOFR future 
						has very small bid-ask spread. Third, its margin savings are higher (up to 80% comparing to 
						75% of those of Eurodollars and 75% of those of Fed Funds). Fourth, SOFR Futures has easy 
						spread trading against Eurodollar and Fed Fund futures via CME Globex intercommodity 
						spreads.</p>

					<h3>3. Reverse Convertibles</h3>
					<h4>3.1 Introduction</h4>
					<p>Reverse Convertibles are a special type of bond whose yields are linked to the performance of 
						a single stock. The offering yields usually fall within a high range, which can be as high as 25% 
						or more. These notes are considered coupon-bearing investment instruments with payouts at 
						maturity. Most maturities of reverse convertibles range from three months to one year. These 
						notes are usually issued by large financial institutions. However, the companies whose stocks 
						are linked to RCNs have no involvement in the products.</p>

					<h4>3.2 How are payouts determined?</h4>
					<p>RCNs can be divided into two parts: debt instrument and put option. Before maturity, RCNs 
						pay out the stated coupon rate, usually as quarterly payments. This constant rate reflects the 
						general volatility of the underlying stock, with greater potential volatility in the stock's 
						performance, the more risk the investor takes. The higher the risk, the more value investor get 
						for the put option; this translates into a higher coupon rate.</p>
					<p>When the RCN matures, investors will receive either 100% of their original investment back 
						or a predetermined number of the underlying stock's shares. This number is determined by 
						dividing their original investment amount by the stock's initial price.</p>

					<h4>3.3 Structures of payoff</h4>
					<p>There are two structures used to determine whether they will receive their original investment 
						amount or the stock:</p>
					<p>Basic Structure: At maturity, if the stock closes at or above the initial price, the investor will 
						receive 100% of their original investment amount. If the stock closes below the initial price, 
						they'll get the predetermined number of shares. This means they'll end up with shares that are 
						worth less than their original investment.</p>
					<p>Knock-In Structure: If before maturity date, the stock price falls below the boundary level and 
						the closing share price falls under the initial price, you'll still receive either 100% of your initial 
						investment or shares of the underlying stock at maturity. With this structure, though, you'll also 
						have some downside protection.</p>

					</span>

					<h4>3.4 Risks of RCNs</h4>
					<p>Call Provision: Some RCNs include a feature that could take RCN from investors just when 
						it's kicking out terrific yields, and prevailing interest rates are low.</p>
					<p>For small investors, reverse convertibles offer a high level of income for a low minimum initial 
						investment. But investors typically don't participate in any gains in the underlying stock, and 
						if the stock falls sharply, they can lose much of their investment.</p>

					<h4>3.5 Targeting at what type of investor</h4>
					<p>RCNs could be suitable for investors looking for predictable, higher-income streams than can 
						be found on traditional fixed-income investments and can tolerate the risk of losing some of 
						the principal.</p>
					<p>Investors should only buy into RCNs when they believe that the underlying stock will not drop 
						below the knock-in level.</p>

					<h3>4. Green Bonds</h3>
					<h4>4.1 Background</h4>
					<p>In recent years, green bonds have been extremely popular in the market as more and more 
						investors are starting to realize the importance of environment-related issues. Besides, issuing 
						green bonds can increase the financing means of companies with strong environmental 
						performance. This is also considered a bonus for accelerating sustainable transition for 
						companies. </p>

					<h4>4.2 Definition of green bonds</h3>
					<p>A green bond is a type of fixed-income instrument that is specifically earmarked to raise money 
						for climate and environmental projects. Specifically for the Chinese market, the Catalogue of 
						Projects Supported by Green Bonds (2021), which was released in 2021, provides the first 
						definition of green bonds. Green bonds are marketable securities that are issued in accordance 
						with legal procedures and with agreed principal and interest repayment, including but not 
						limited to green financial bonds, green corporate bonds, green corporate bonds, green debt 
						financing instruments, and green asset-backed securities, and are used exclusively to support 
						green industries, green projects or green economic activities that meet the prescribed conditions.</p>

					<h4>4.3 The benefits of issuing green bonds for corporations</h4>
					<p>There are many benefits for an issuer to issue green bonds:</p>
					<p><b>• Highlights their green asset:</b> By issuing green bonds, the issuer can show that their 
						assets are well diversified and sustainable, thus gaining a good reputation from the 
						investor</p>
					<p><b>• “Green premium”:</b> Through the issuance of green bonds, the issuers usually pay less 
						to fund green bonds as the yield is lower. The issuer can enjoy a lower cost of debt by 
						issuing more green bonds. As there exists a huge demand for green bonds, the investors 
						are satisfied even if they receive less from those green bonds, which leads to a “green 
						premium” in the green bonds.</p>
					<p><b>• Enhance a green profile:</b> By issuing green bonds to attract more ESG investors, 
						companies can make their investor base more diversified. Gain a high potential of 
						attracting more investors.</p>

					<h4>4.4 The benefit of buying green bonds for investors</h4>
					<p>There are also incentives for investors to buy green bonds</p>
					<p><b>• Risk diversification:</b> Green bonds can help mitigate climate-change-related risks in 
						the portfolio due to changing policies. Instead, a green bond invests in climate-friendly 
						assets, such as green buildings and renewable energy which bear lower credit risk 
						overtime.</p>
					<p><b>• Strong performance:</b> As the companies issuing green bonds are generally large 
						companies with a good reputation and ESG performance, green bonds have also 
						performed very well in the market.</p>
					
					<h4>4.5 The future of green bonds</h4>
					<p>There is still a large capital gap for achieving carbon peaking, which needs to be compensated 
						in the form of market-based financing. "For the realization of carbon peak and carbon neutral 
						capital needs, there are a lot of calculations, to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutral capital 
						needs of the scale level is a trillion RMB", this level of huge investment government funds can 
						only cover a small part of the gap to rely on market capital to make up for the market-oriented 
						approach, to guide the financial system to provide the required investment and necessary 
						financing support needed.</p>
					<p>The greenness of domestic green bonds will be further enhanced, and the earlier they are issued, 
						the more they can enjoy the current relatively relaxed policy support environment. The level 
						of the greenness of green bonds is important to attract socially responsible domestic and foreign 
						investors, and also has a greater impact on the reputation mechanism. At present, the standards 
						of domestic green projects have been unified and are basically in line with international 
						standards, but the greenness of domestic green bonds needs to be improved, including two 
						points: first, a larger proportion of the funds raised from bonds should be used for green projects;
						second, the certification and evaluation system, information disclosure system and duration 
						management of green bonds need to continue to be strengthened.</p>
